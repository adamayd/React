# Learn React.js: The Basics by Eve Porcello

This course is featured on Lynda.com.  This is my personal repo of the cumulative and completed exercise files.  Things I found out the hard way so you don't have to.  

* Since React 16 deprecates React.createClass you must use React 15 or older.  For a basics course, it's still great.
* Since Babel 6 will not run as an in browser transpiler, you must use Babel 5.8 or older.  

Generall I've found this course to be a nice on ramp to more in depth courses on React.
